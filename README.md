# 🎓 Language Learning Sandbox

A personal repository for exploring and mastering programming languages through hands-on practice and experimentation.

## 📖 Overview

This repository serves as my dedicated workspace for language learning experiments, primarily featuring exercises from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) and other coding challenges. Each language directory contains practical problems that help develop proficiency and understanding of language-specific paradigms and idioms.

## 💻 Languages

Currently exploring:

- **Clojure** - Functional programming with Lisp syntax
- **jq** - Command-line JSON processing
- **Kotlin** - Modern JVM language
- **Python** - General-purpose programming and scripting
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript development

## 📁 Structure

```text

├── kotlin/       # JVM-based exercises
├── python/       # Python fundamentals and algorithms
└── typescript/   # Type-safe JavaScript exercises
```

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed to:

- Practice core concepts across different programming paradigms
- Build muscle memory through repetitive problem-solving
- Explore language-specific features and standard libraries
- Maintain a reference collection of solutions and patterns
- Track progress in my polyglot programming journey

## 📝 Note

Solutions and code in this repository represent learning progress and experimental work. They may not always reflect production-ready practices as the focus is on exploration and understanding fundamentals.
